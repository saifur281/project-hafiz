## Introduction

Hi I am Hafiz Ahmed. I have build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB.

The App is called "Hafiz Story" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

Setup:

- run `npm i && npm start` for both client and server side to start the app
